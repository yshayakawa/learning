# 2. surveying

**"Large errors? It's highly accurate. The slope of the pole is well shown. "**

---

## Before Surveying...: **Is the equipment in compliance with the Radio Act**?

- Compliance with Radio Act
- Use of equipment without a technical standards conformity certification mark (GITEKI mark) may be illegal.
  - e.g.: Made in foreign countries (imported by individuals, small quantities imported by vendors)
  - e.g., up-to-date equipment (may not have completed a technical compliance application)

  - Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications ["Homepage for Radio Use"](http://www.tele.soumu.go .jp/j/adm/monitoring/summary/qa/giteki_mark /) commentary.
- On the same page, you can find [devices that have received a certificate of conformity to technical standards (GITEKI)] (http://www.tele. soumu.go.jp/giteki/SearchServlet?pageID=js 01) 
- EMLID Reach RS, Reach RTK is available for domestic use
  - The base board is an Intel Edison (construction design certification number 007-AC0199), so it can be used as is.

- The company's new Reach RS+ and Reach M+ products have not yet been submitted for approval of the technical regulations
  - It is illegal to use it in Japan. imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine of not more than one million yen (Radio Act, Article 110)

## PPK analysis with L1-DGNSS and RTKLIB: Surveying
**Surveying (field work)**
1. setting the positioning satellite system and frequency to be acquired
    - Standards: GPS, GLONASS, QZSS, 5 Hz
    - In the case of a moving object, you can (maybe) reproduce smaller movements with increased frequency.
      - In the case of a UAV flying at 10 m/s, this means measurements every 2 meters at 5 Hz
      - Increasing the type and frequency of positioning satellite systems to be acquired will increase the amount of data.
      - BeiDou (China) has a high number of flights over Japan, but it has not been acquired by GNSS-based Control Stations
2. base installation and observation
    - Minimum observation time for the Base: baseline length (km) from the Control Staion x 10 minutes (minimum 45 minutes)
    - Normally, a long enough period of time is available during a Rover observation
3. set up the Rover at the survey point and start observation
    - Rover's observation time: from 3 minutes
    - extended time is necessary if low visibility of the sky, long baseline length, thin vegetation shielding, or high GDOP
4. end of Base observation

## General Notes on Base/Rover Installation and Observation
- **Base**
  - A place with open-sky, no shaking, no people passing

- **Rover**
    - The bipod should be set up facing to the wind direction.
    - Keep your hand on the pole on windy days.

## Rover installation and observations.
**Rover installation and observation (example of operation with EMLID Reach RS/RTK)**
1. Place Rover at the survey point (strictly perpendicular as much as possible)
    - If a 2 m pole is inclined for 20 minutes (0.33 degrees), an error of 1.3 cm in the horizontal direction is produced.
    - Use a precise and calibrated pole
    - Careful, gentle installation!
    - It's not good to look at the air bubble tube from an angled view.
2. Start observation (Raw data is "on")
    - Care about wind-driven tipping and swaying.
3. taking photographs
    - Distant views of the measurement environment
    - Close-up photos of the measurement point
4. end the observation ("off" raw data)
